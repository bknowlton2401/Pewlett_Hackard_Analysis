Retirement Analysis of Pewlett Hackard

## Programs Used
VS Code, pgAdmin 4, SQL

## Purpose
In this challenge, the purpose was to scroll through various databases to find current employees who were nearing retirement age, determine what departments they were in and who would be a good candidate to refer to a Mentorship program.

## Results
In this analysis, we were able to create 4 new databases that catagorized employees by their Retirement Title, Retiring Title, Unique Title and Mentorship Eligibility. By taking the original 6 databases and writing code to vet through the thousands of employees, we were able to get a better picture of how many employees will be retiring over the next few years.  With all of their experience, their knowledge is needed and could be used to train new employees to lessen the learning curve. 

## Summary
The results of this analysis show Pewlett-Hackard, that they are about to face a "silver tsunami".  They will need to replace nearly 60,000 Senior Engineer and staff members, approximately 45,000 engineers, 12,000 staff personnel, and about 4500 employees in leadership or management positions.

With only approximately 1500 current retirement-ready employees, there are not nearly enough to successfully mentor new employees.  They will have to be creative and create teams of retirement-ready employees to mentor or reach out to recently retired employee to return as mentors.
